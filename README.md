# Master's Thesis by Jakob R. Juergens

This repository contains all code that was used in the creation of my master's thesis "Bugni and Horowitz (2021) Permutation Tests for the Equality of Distributions of Functional Data".
The thesis was written under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Dominik Liebl in 2022.
